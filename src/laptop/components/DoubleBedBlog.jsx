                <h2 className="dbedblog-subtitle">Understanding Bed Sizes and Space</h2>

                <p className="dbedblog-paragraph">
                    Before buying, measure your room carefully to match the right bed size:
                </p>

                <ul className="dbedblog-list">
                    <li><strong>Double bed:</strong> About 72 x 54 inchesâ€”ideal for compact bedrooms or couples wanting a cozy fit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Queen size bed:</strong> Roughly 72 x 60 inchesâ€”extra width, perfect for couples or guest rooms.</li>
                    <li><strong>King size bed:</strong> Around 72 x 72 inchesâ€”ultimate comfort, suitable for families or those who love more sleeping space.</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="dbedblog-paragraph">
                    Also, consider storage options like pull-out drawers or headboards with compartmentsâ€”essential for Mumbai apartments where every inch counts.

                <p className="dbedblog-paragraph">
                    Not all beds are created equal. Hereâ€™s how different types perform:
                </p>

                <ul className="dbedblog-list">
                    <li><strong>Solid Wood Beds:</strong> Strong and elegant, but heavy, costly, and prone to warping in humid climates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engineered Wood Beds (Best Choice):</strong> Stylish, durable, and resistant to warping or cracking. Affordable, storage-friendly designs make them perfect for modern bedrooms. Eco-conscious manufacturing adds a sustainable touch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metal Beds:</strong> Lightweight and minimal, but may rust, squeak, and lack the warmth and luxury feel of wood.</li>
                </ul>
