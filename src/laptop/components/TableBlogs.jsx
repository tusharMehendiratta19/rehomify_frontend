                </h1>

                <p className="tbBlog-paragraph">
                    A table is never just a surface‚Äîit‚Äôs the functional centrepiece of your home. From a coffee table in the living room to a sturdy study table in a student‚Äôs corner, the right table enhances comfort, utility, and style. But with so many options, finding the ‚Äúperfect one‚Äù can feel overwhelming.
                </p>

                <p className="tbBlog-paragraph">
                    That‚Äôs why in 2025, more homeowners are choosing modern wood tables‚Äîa smart solution that blends durability, design, and value, without the heavy price tag of marble or solid wood.
                </p>

                <h2 className="tbBlog-subtitle">Step 1: Identify Your Needs and Space</h2>

                <p className="tbBlog-paragraph">
                    Before buying, ask yourself: Where will I place this table, and how will I use it?
                </p>

                <ul className="tbBlog-list">
                    <li>Coffee tables anchor the living room, perfect for drinks, books, and d√©cor.</li>
                    <li>Centre tables complement sofa sets and often include hidden storage.</li>
                    <li>Study tables are daily essentials for students and professionals.</li>
                    <li>Side or console tables add compact storage and decorative appeal near seating or entryways.</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="tbBlog-paragraph">
                    üëâ Fun fact: For bachelors, the coffee table often becomes a second cupboard. For families, it turns into a catch-all for toys, snacks, and remotes. For students, it‚Äôs both a study partner and midnight snack station.
                </p>

                <h2 className="tbBlog-subtitle">Why Smart Wood Furniture Wins in 2025</h2>

                    <li>Metal: Lightweight and modern, but less cozy, and may squeak or rust over time.</li>
                </ul>
