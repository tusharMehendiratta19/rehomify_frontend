                    Choosing the Perfect Engineered Wood Single Bed for Your Home in 2025
                </h1>

                <p className="sbBlog-paragraph">
                    Choosing the right single bed is about finding the perfect balance of comfort, smart design, and space efficiency. Whether youâ€™re furnishing a small bedroom, setting up a student apartment, or adding a guest bed, the right choice can completely transform your home. In 2025, engineered wood single beds have become the go-to optionâ€”offering durability, modern looks, and great value for money.

                <h2 className="sbBlog-subtitle">Understand Your Space and Size Requirements</h2>

                <p className="sbBlog-paragraph">
                    Before buying a single bed, measure your room carefully. A standard single bed measures around 72 x 36 inches, but compact single beds are perfect for small rooms and studio apartments where every inch matters.

                <p className="sbBlog-paragraph">
                    For students or renters, compact designs help maximize floor area while still providing restful sleep. Always check that your single bed frame and mattress fit comfortably without overcrowding your space.
